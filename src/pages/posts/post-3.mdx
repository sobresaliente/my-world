<h2 class="font-rowdies text-2xl text-sky-300"> Week 3</h2>
<p class="mt-4">It was pretty tough week for me actually. I can't decide what to do with my career. Should I learn data science, game dev, assembly because I want to do it or I should focus on my frontend skills to increase my salary? Because I really want to buy new macbook :D</p>
<p class="mt-4">Meh, whatever. This week I started data science course(currently messing up with pandas not with neural networks). But probably I will try to find second job and focus on getting to the interviews not in Russia. That's pretty hard as I know. </p>
<p class="mt-4">Also I've started learning Three.js. But not so much, I can render smth like rotating cube, but it's really cool I want add smth in about page with three js. </p>
<p class="mt-4">It was pretty hard for me to land a job. To get the interview invite actually. Because I have a bad CV and I need to deploy this website to show my "portfolio" thing. Hope it will help. So I want to focus on state managers this week. I will play with MobX, redux and effector I guess. Wish me luck. This is my first goal.</p>
<p class="mt-4">My second goal is to do algorithms every day so after 2 years of every day grinding I will be pretty good at it.</p>
<p class="mt-4">Oh! And I will send a message to a Evil Martian's HR's I really want to work with them.</p>
