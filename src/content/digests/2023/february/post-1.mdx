  Hello everyone! That week was very messy for me. I haven't completed anything that I wanted but
  that doesn't matter so much. I could learn state managers when I will need them. On that week I've
  updated that blog to Astro 2.0, but haven't implemented new features yet. It excites me that I'm
  becoming aware of new releases in the industry. Because like a month ago I haven't read about
  changes even in major versions of Angular. It's really aspect that I like. To be aware and
  research new features by myself.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  Also I started new side job. But it was not the best decision. But it's still good motivation to
  learn the basics of Golang and play around with AngularJS to flex that I've used it. Also it's
  good money for me now, so I hope they will not fire me :D
</p>

  On the main job I played with Ionic that week. And it's awful, I enjoy React Native much more.
  Maybe I will try Flutter someday, but styling and making layouts with Ionic is a complete mess.
  Awful developer experience.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  But I still stay consistent on developing that blog, I guess today I will pin the link in my all
  platforms. So people could learn a bit more about me. I hope to end active development of that
  blog in the next week and just add new features when I will be bored with other projects.
