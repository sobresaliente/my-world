 Hey! That week I decided to start developing my programming hobbies. I have taken the Golang course at the university. I don't enjoy that language, but it's a lot of hype around it. Also, I need it for my job... 
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
 On the other hand, I've downloaded Unity and Blender. I find the solo indie game developer videos so inspiring that I've decided to download Unity and do something on my free time. Still trying to get used to that interface. It's a bit overwhelming ;D
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  I've started to write the article about webpack, and I will try to release it during the next
  weekends. I'm playing with a lot of plugins, loaders to develop that area. To understand how it
  works under React for example.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  Also started development of main functionality of Visible Light. Now I'm working on layout of the
  application. It's almost done, so I will continue to work on it this week.
</p>

As usual, I haven't accomplished my goal from the last week. I wanted to learn WebGL or Canvas but haven't felt that I need it so anyway... This week I will continue learning Golang and Unity. Also I will spend some time learnign all types of test like screenshot tests, unit tests.
