  The problem with these blog posts that I can't remember what exactly I've done during the week...
  But I will try to remember it on the next week.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  On my main job I've tried to make a parser for chess notation turns. I have 3 buffers from the
  chess board bluetooth adapter and I need to make the changeset of the board state and store the
  turn notation to the database. As we're not in a hurry, I've decided to try to code the solution
  by myself and still figuring out how to do it. On the my side job I've worked with scrapers and
  Puppeter. Interesting and tough experience as I am creating the scrapper for government website
  and I need to ask a lot of permissions every time.

  Also, I moved that blog to Astro 2.0, content collections is a killer feature it's so much easier
  to maintain a lot of mdx documents now. I've taken a lot at other features but haven't worked with
  them yet.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  I've started to write the article about webpack, and I will try to release it during the next
  weekends. I'm playing with a lot of plugins, loaders to develop that area. To understand how it
  works under React for example.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  Also started development of main functionality of Visible Light. Now I'm working on layout of the
  application. It's almost done, so I will continue to work on it this week.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  And finally, I will play with WebGL and canvas this week. My friend shared with me an idea of the
  small project on a couple of evenings. If I will have time I will work on it and I will finally
  try WebGL or canvas. It is the good start for learning Three.js.

<h2 class='text-xl text-sky-400'>Interesting articles that I've read this week: </h2>

<ol class="pt-4">
  <li><a href='https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/' class='text-sky-300'>1. Typescript 5.0 beta</a><div>I don't know. Pretty strange change log for major update. The only interesting thing is how they reduced the size of the bundle twice.</div></li>

  <li class="mt-4"><a href='https://civet.dev/' class='text-sky-300'>2. Civet</a><div>It's not an article. But it's interesting to check the cheat sheet. Looks interesting but as I understand it's more useful for backend developers. Because all front end synax like JSX and templates is pug like syntax and I hate it.</div></li>
