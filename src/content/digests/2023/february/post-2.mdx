  Hey. How is your Saturday evening going? The first month of 2023 has passed. I hope you haven't
  forgotten your goals on that year and let's keep on track together!
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  This week I started making starter repository for my side projects. I have decided to use webpack
  for now and then learn more about other bundlers: Turbopack, Vite and so on. While I was reading
  webpack documentation and medium articles I have understood that there are no articles that could
  explain why we should use bundlers(especially webpack) with the best practices how to structure
  configuration file in the big projects. So I have started to write webpack introduction article
  and then I will post it on that blog and on Medium. Then I have an idea to compare webpack with
  other bundlers. But at first, I need to configure webpack for the large project because I have a
  feeling that Vite isn't flexible enough for now to configure it on the enterprise size
  applications.

  Also, I moved that blog to Astro 2.0, content collections is a killer feature it's so much easier
  to maintain a lot of mdx documents now. I've taken a lot at other features but haven't worked with
  them yet.
</p>

<p class='mt-4'>
  This week, I will continue working on the starter project(bundler, linters, tests and
  ui-libraries). And I will try to end introduction webpack article on that week.

Now I can make a reference to that article in purpose to prevent using it in the project.</div></li>
